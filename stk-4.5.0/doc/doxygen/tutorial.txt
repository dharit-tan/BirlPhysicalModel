The Synthesis ToolKit is a set of C++ classes.  In order to go beyond the simple example programs we provide, it is necessary to know some basics about programming in C and C++.  STK's "target audience" includes people who:
<UL>
<LI>want to create audio DSP and/or synthesis programs</LI>
<LI>want to use our unit generators and input/output routines rather than code their own</LI>
<LI>want to learn about synthesis and processing algorithms</LI>
<LI>wish to teach real-time synthesis and processing and wish to use some of our classes and examples</LI>
</UL>

Most ToolKit programmers will likely end up writing a class or two for their own particular needs, but this task is typically simplified by making use of pre-existing STK classes (filters, oscillators, etc.).

The following tutorial chapters describe many of the fundamental ToolKit concepts and classes.  All tutorial programs are included in the <TT>projects/examples</TT> directory.
